**Project title:** Six Degrees of Francis Bacon: 

**Project URL:** [(http://sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/?ids=10000473&min_confidence=60&type=network)]

**Project Director(s):** Christopher Warren, Daniel Shore 

**Summary**

The Six Degrees of Francis Bacon (SDFB) is an online recreation of the social network of early modern scholars and students. The early modern social network purpose was so scholars and students from all over the world can collaborate, expand, and critique current research and academia. Unlike it’s contemporaries, SDFB is extensive and collaborative, meaning that anyone or any associations can be added, removed, or modified. 

**Project Review**

At first look, the project can feel a bit overwhelming and difficult to understand. I certainly had no idea what I was looking at. It seemed like a spider web with a bunch of different names on it. Some of the names on the map I could recognize were significant, others I didn’t recognize, or I didn’t know why they were placed on the map. For example, I didn’t understand why King Henry Queen Elizabeth were on there, they weren’t scholars from what I remembered (I’m not knowledgeable on history, so I don’t know if I remembered that correctly). There two modes that you can see the visualization as. There’s Hooke mode and then there’s concentric mode.

Hooke mode shows all the important people and just has lines connected which seemed a bit easier to understand. Concentric mode, I will admit was difficult to understand. There’s one network and then there’s names that seem to be connected. However, it’s only one network you can’t identify how it relates to the rest of the map or how it’s significant.

Another aspect I found about this website is that it's difficult to backtrack. There is a visualize button, which is great, but it doesn’t get back to the original map that you were looking at. Instead, it just re structures the map to center on the person you were looking at. Say if you are looking at the Francis Bacon Network, and then you click on Thomas Hobbes. If you want to go back to the Francis Bacon Network, you must find the Francis Bacon Network within the restructured Thomas Hobbes Network to get back to the original Francis Bacon Network. This is a minor flaw and doesn’t take away from the project itself. However even people who are interested in modern English scholars could appreciate an ease of use.

Since I am not an expert, or even interested in looking at 19th century scholars, the very first thing I did was go to the about page to figure out what the network was about. The about me was helpful and I think they did a good job of showing the historical significance of the modern scholars. They showed the significance by illustrating all the different connections the scholars had to each other, and how those connections formed bigger networks. All of which were formed (I assume) to share knowledge and collaborate with one another. 


The goal of this project was to show how all the different scholars are connected through one another and how that impacted how knowledge was shared or not shared. How reigning monarchs impacted academic networks. As you can tell, the largest number of threads, came through queen Elizabeth and James IV. Every connection always had a way back to King James and Elizabeth or any other monarch in the web of early modern historians. Meaning many academic connections were formed though monarchs.

It was also great that there was a hyperlink to bios of the people you pressed on. For example, if you press on John Chamberlin on the map, there’s an oxford link and a JSTOR link. The oxford link is a biography and the JSTOR link leads to scholarly articles about John Chamberlin. This was an excellent idea because the map had too many links on screen for there to be a bio as soon as you clicked on it. Which is normally what I’m used to seeing when I look at data visualizations and maps.

**Technology**

 The entire codebase for the site, which uses Angular, Ruby on Rails, and D3, is available in our Git hub repo. The R code is used for network inference of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. This website is hosted by Carnegie Mellon University Libraries, and data is available for download both on this site and as part of the Folger Shakespeare Library's digital collections. The website worked great, without few glitches. The project creators did a great job of creating a seamless experience in which to display the network. 
 
 
**Conclusion**

Overall, this website does a thorough and detailed job of showing all the different connections between scholars and educators in the early modern era. The creators did an excellent job of creating an interactive and seamless experience, while still displaying all the information about the early modern scholars.
