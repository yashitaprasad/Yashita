**Background**

Timeline for Empire (TFE) by Katrina Phillips is an examination of the creation of the U.S. empire – and historical and contemporary resistance to the impositions of empire. From encounters with Native americans in various United states territories. The timeline covers a variety of topics. Everything from race, imperialism, citizenship and belonging, and inclusion and exclusion of various people. 


This project was directed by Professor Katrina Philips who primarily teaches Native history, the American West, the U.S. Empire, public history, as well as representation and performance. She created this project in collaboration with her students. Due to covid, and a switch from the semester to quarter model, she decided to give her students this project to cover more material as well as have a project that could be done remotely, should the need occur. Each student was responsible for 10-15 entries on the timeline. The only requirement was that the entries had to relate to the creation, growth, or maintenance of the U.S. empire. 


**Timeline**

When you first get to the website, there is a brief synopsis about what the timeline is about. This is great, since there is no about this website tab, the URL just sends you straight to the timeline. The timeline covers an extensive amount of information. Each post on the timeline is structured as some sort of narrative to set up an event or period into historical context. Then each post explores the causes behind U.S. expansion and the responses to expansion by those subjected to it.

I did find the project a little difficult to get into, since there is no about the website, and it just goes straight into the timeline, it was difficult to find the information about the project directors. I only knew who the project was written by because I found another review of the project done by Jason A. Hepler on reviews in DH. I think an about project, somewhere on the timeline or off in the corner could easily fix this. 


The timeline is extensive and covers over 400 years of history. The timeline covers the rise of the United States in becoming a global Empire. There are many historical events, movements and figures that led to the rise of the United States. 


At the bottom there a legend of sorts if the whole timeline where you can scroll through of the of the points in the timeline. There are buttons where you can zoom in and out on specific time points on the timeline. This is great because it can be overwhelming to see the entire project right from the get go.

I enjoyed the fact there was forward and backwards button on the time, that way you can always go back to what you where previously looking at. This way you don’t get lost, and have to refresh the entire page to get back to where you were. This makes for an easier viewing experience. 


The posts are created by various students and each point in the timeline has its own bibliography. This is great, since there is so much information and many different historical events to cover it makes sense to for the bibliography to be at the end of each post instead of at the end of the project itself like a lot of other projects do. 

**Technology**

I think this is a great reference to where I want to begin with my timeline and website. I don’t know if I’ll use the same software that Timeline for Empire uses, but I think the layout of the post for each point on the timeline and the actual timeline being on the bottom is something I want to do for my own grant. I’d probably want the timeline to be more interactive than, what this timeline was. While it doesn’t cover a similar topic as my timeline since my project is on the astronaut Yuri Gagarin.

**Conclusion**

Overall, I enjoyed the presentation of the timeline. It was simple and easy to follow. I learned a lot about U.S imperialism, as well as several other topics. This is a great way to teach many topics with one website. I think this was a great idea for a collaboration project and was an ingenious idea.
