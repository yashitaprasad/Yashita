**Background**

Timeline for Empire by Katrina Phillips is an examination of the creation of the U.S. empire – and historical and contemporary resistance to the impositions of empire. From encounters with Native nations in the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawai’i to Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and other U.S.-held territories, our timeline examines race and imperialism, citizenship and belonging, and inclusion and exclusion, on national and international stages. Our timeline covers several centuries and most of the world, demonstrating the historical -- and current -- reach of American empire.

**Timeline**

When you first get to the website, there is a brief synopsis about what the timeline is about. This is great, since there is no about this website tab, the URL just sends you straight to the timeline.
