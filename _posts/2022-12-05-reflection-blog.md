### Review one Blog

**Introduction** 

Now that I’ve taken this course, Digital Humanities to me means the study of how humanities intersect with technology. My definition of DH hasn’t really changed because when I first took the course, I didn’t have any prior knowledge of DH to base my definition on. So, I have a better understanding of the field now that I’ve taken this class. 

**Readings**

The readings were helpful in trying to understand how DH could be applied outside of a classroom. They also helped in trying to define DH, because I felt like DH could be a lot of different things.  A reading that I found interesting were Nielson Norman Group, “Text Scanning Patterns: Eye tracking Evidence”. This paper tracked eye movement when people were skimming text, to see what part of the passage people gravitated to. They found that people often read headers, and the first sentence of each paragraph which made sense as I had done that as well.

Another online tool I found interesting was the Hemingway app that judged readability. The app worked by letting the user insert the text they wanted to check readability for, and then assigned a 1-12 grade level for that text. Which was helpful in determining whether writing was readable or not. It was also helpful that we went over what would count as DH project and what wouldn’t count as a DH project. Especially for the review two were we needed to pick out own project and have it related to our grant project. 

**Assignments**

Reviews 1 and 2 were probably the assignments I enjoyed but also struggled on at times. For my review one project, I reviewed The Six Degrees of Francis Bacon. The website was fun to explore, and the visuals were impressive. However, sometimes coming up with content to review was tricky because the site was extensive and figuring out which parts of the site were relevant to include and which point would not be helpful in a DH review could get a bit confusing.

For Review Two, we had to find a DH project that also related to our own project. However, since I was doing a timeline on one person, I had to find a timeline Dh project rather than a DH project on the person. This was great since, it related more to how I wanted to structure my timeline rather than having similar content to my own grant project. 

**Grant Project**

Lastly the Grant Project was our semester long project, that we had many different parts for. I liked the fact that we got to do multiple parts for it, and that we could choose it ourselves. Even though it required a lot of research, it was on a topic I liked so working on it was enjoyable. 

**Conclusion**

I definitely grown as a writer in this class. This class was different than other English classes I’ve taken because like most of the writing I did previously was more academic and longer. In this class we had to be shorter and more concise while still getting the point across.  Overall, this class was a nice change in pace, and I really enjoyed taking this class.
