##### About Me 

Hi! My name’s Yashita, and a I’m a Computer Science Major. I’m a senior here at Christopher Newport University and a transfer student.
I lived in Leesburg until 2012, then moved to Ashburn which where I currently live when I'm not at school. My mother is an accountant, and my father works in business. I have one sibling, a younger brother named. Over this summer break I went the outer banks and myrtle beach, which was fun. 


I used to have fishes when I was younger, although I always wanted a dog (I could never convince my parents to get one).


My favorite Marvel superhero is Spider-Man.


In my free time love I enjoy watching anime. My current favorite anime would be _Attack on Titan_. So far, I’ve watched _Demon Slayer_, _Jujitsu Kaisen_, _My Hero Academia_ and _Banana Fish_.

##### Academic Background 

I’m taking this class to satisfy the writing intensive portion of my degree. I wanted to take digital humanities to improve my professional and academic writing. Digital Humanities sounds like an interesting field, and I’m excited to learn more about it. Digital Humanities seemed like an interesting combination of applying principles learned in humanities fields, but instead applying it to the digital world. I started off college as a political science major but switched a semester in when I realized the field wasn’t for me. So, it’s nice to come back to a humanities class with more experience in college. 


Although I don’t plan on pursuing a career in a writing, English, or a Humanities field, I thought it would be helpful further into my academic career to know how to write clearly and concisely while being formal. Especially when pursuing academic research and internships in the future. 

I plan to do internships in the summer of 2023. I am interested in going into sofware deveopment after graduation.
